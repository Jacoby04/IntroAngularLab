IntroAngularLab
===============
There are several goals in this lab:
   * Understand how to use Angular to create views and view-models for an ordinary JavaScript model
   * Understand the structure of an Angular app that makes sense
   * Understand how the HTML and Angular parts of the view relate to each other
   * Writing at least a couple tests in Mocha or Jasmine that can test your Angular code
   * Continue using HTML and CSS to make a page look decent and contain information you care about
   * Continue using Mocha tests

This starter code is meant to give you a structure where you can put your work.
